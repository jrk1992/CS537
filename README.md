Module 7
NavCam is a camera on the Mars Rover used for navigation purposes. NavCam takes images of the Martian surface and sends it to Earth, which are in turn used to navigate the Rover. NavCam was a module in a rather very large project to simulate the functioning of Mars Rovers. The simulator was based on multi-threading and socket programming. This Module coordinates with other modules of the project, turns on the nav-cam, takes pictures using an external camera, converts it to binary and forwards it to requesting module in JSON format.
